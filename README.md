# 🔧 Smart Predictive Maintenance System for Electric Vehicles

This project is focused on building a **predictive maintenance system** using real-world engine sensor data to forecast potential failures or identify engine conditions. This system is useful for electric vehicle (EV) fleets, industrial IoT systems, and smart automotive applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Predict engine condition based on sensor readings
- Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for classification
- Visualizes **feature importance**
- Modular and easy to scale with real-time data sources
- Clean accuracy and performance metrics

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains various sensor readings such as:

- Temperature
- Pressure
- Vibration
- RPM
- Voltage

**Target variable**: `Engine Condition` (indicates health or failure status of the engine)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## 🧠 Model

This project uses:

- **Random Forest Classifier** from `scikit-learn`
- **Train/Test Split** for evaluation
- **Classification report & Accuracy score**
- **Feature Importance Graph** for explainability

---

## 📈 Output Sample

```
Accuracy: 0.94

Classification Report:
               precision    recall  f1-score   support
Healthy             0.96      0.95      0.95       100
At Risk            0.91      0.93      0.92       120
Failure             0.95      0.94      0.94        80
```

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a **real-time sensor feed** (MQTT, Kafka, etc.)
- Build a **web dashboard** using Streamlit or Flask
- Deploy as an API endpoint using FastAPI
- Add **explainable AI** tools like SHAP
